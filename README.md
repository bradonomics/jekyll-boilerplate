# Jekyll Boilerplate
Jekyll boilerplate is a starter kit for Jekyll themes. It uses my preferred CSS framework and Gulp tasks.

The repo is setup with a gulpfile if you want to use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). The `/dev` directory is where your Sass and pre processed JavaScript will live. If you prefer not to use Sass or Gulp, you'll need to manually move all the CSS from the .scss files to a styles.css file in the root directory.

I wrote a blog post about [how I build custom Genesis child themes](http://bradonomics.com/genesis-boilerplate/). The notes in that post are very applicable to this repo.

The install scrip in that post is only applicable to the Genesis Boilerplate repo. You can find the Jekyll Boilerplate install script here:

## Getting Started

To start your new theme with Jekyll Boilerplate, you can [Download the files from GitHub](https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) (or clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-boilerplate.git`). Remember this is a starting point for a custom theme and pretty vanilla as is. If it doesn't make it into 90% of my custom theme work, it isn't in the boilerplate.

### What's in the download?

The download includes a rewrite of [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com), some dummy content to to check styles and formatting, a gulp file with my preferred tasks, a development configuration file to help with the build, and probably some other things I'm forgetting.
