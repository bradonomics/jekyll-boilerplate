# Jekyll Boilerplate
Jekyll boilerplate is a starter kit for Jekyll themes.

## Getting Started

To start your a theme with Jekyll Boilerplate, you can [Download the files from GitHub](https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-boilerplate/archive/master.zip) (or clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-boilerplate.git`). Remember this is a starting point for a custom website, if it doesn't make it into 90% of my builds, it isn't in the boilerplate.

### What's in the download?

The download includes some dummy content (most of which I swiped from Michael Rose's [unit test repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-unit-test)) to to check styles and formatting, a development configuration file to help with the build, and probably some other things I'm forgetting.
